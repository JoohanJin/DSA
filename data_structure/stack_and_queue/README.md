# Stack and Queue

## Stack
- LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering
- the most recent item added to the stack is the first item to be removed.

#### Operations
- pop(): Remove the top item from the stack
- push(item): Add an item to the top of the stack
- peek(): Return the top of the stack
- isEmpty(): Return true iff the stack is empty

- Does not offer constant-time access to the ith item.
- Constant add and remove.
    - since it does not require shifting elements around

## Queue
- FIFO (first-in first-out) orderderng
