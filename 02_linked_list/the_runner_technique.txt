The "runner" (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems.
The runner technique means that you iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the other.

The "fast" node might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that the "slow" node iterate through.

For example, suppose you have a linked list a1->a2->...->an->b1->b2->...->bn
and you wanted to rearrange it into a1->b1->a2->b2->...->an->bn.
You do not know the length of the linked list (but you do know that the length is an even number)

You could have one pointer pi (the fast pointer) move every two elements for every one move that pj makes.
When pi hits the end of the linked list, pj will be at the midpoint. Then, move pi back to the front and begin "weaving" the elements.

On each iteration, pj selects an element and inserts it after pi.
